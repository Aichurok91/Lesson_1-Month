#ЗАдача5
# name="""Advertising companies say advertising is necessary and important.
# It informs people about new products. Advertising hoardings in the street make our environment colourful. 
# And adverts on TV are often funny. 
# Sometimes they are mini-dramas and we wait for the next programme in the mini-drama. 
# Advertising can educate, too. Adverts tell us about new, healthy products. 
# And adverts in magazines give us ideas for how to look prettier, be fashionable and be successful. 
# Without advertising, life is boring and colourless.

# But some consumers argue that advertising is a bad thing. 
# They say that advertising is bad for children. 
# Adverts make children ‘pester’ their parents buy things for them. 
# Advertisers know we love our children and want to give them everything. 
# So they use children’s ‘pester power’ to sell their products. 
# Finally, consumers say, if there is advertising there must be rules. 
# Some adverts advertise unhealthy things like cigarettes and make people waste their money.
